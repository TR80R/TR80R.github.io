## How It Works

### Data Storage
- Uses browser localStorage for data persistence
- No backend server required
- All user data, uploads, and interactions stored locally

### Content Flow
1. Creators upload content through dashboard
2. Content stored in localStorage
3. Customer portal loads all content for discovery
4. Interactions (likes, comments, tips) tracked and stored

### Navigation
- Direct links between all portals
- Session-based authentication
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Technical Details

### Built With
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+
- **Styling**: SASS with custom CSS properties
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage/sessionStorage
- **Design**: Dark theme with Nocturna brand colors

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with localStorage support
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- Mobile browsers with touch support

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Touch gestures for customer portal
- Optimized layouts for all screen sizes

## Development

### SASS Compilation
If you need to modify styles:
1. Install SASS: `npm install -g sass`
2. Compile: `sass styles/style.scss styles/style.css`

### Local Testing
- Simply open HTML files in browser
- No build process required
- All dependencies included

## Deployment

### Static Hosting
- Upload all files to any static hosting service
- Works with GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.
- No server-side configuration needed

### Production Considerations
- Currently uses localStorage (client-side only)
- For production, consider migrating to proper database
- Add server-side authentication for security
- Implement cloud storage for file uploads
