Build me a web app using HTML, SASS, and JavaScript for my NSFW brand “Nocturna”. I need the following features:

⸻

🎨 Design & Branding:

Use this color palette across the entire UI:
	•	Midnight Black #0B0B0F – background
	•	Deep Amethyst #5A2A6E – primary/CTAs
	•	Velvet Plum #7F3D67 – secondary text/buttons
	•	Moonlight White #F6F5F3 – main text & input field backgrounds
	•	Rosé Dust #E2A6B7 – highlights/flair, accents

The app should be dark-themed, modern, mobile-responsive, and clean. Font: 'Helvetica Neue' or system sans-serif fallback.

⸻

👤 Auth System:
	•	Build a simple sign-up and login system using localStorage or JSON for this prototype (no backend required).
	•	Store user data: username, email, password, phone, date_joined
	•	After login, redirect the user to their Creator Dashboard

⸻

📥 Creator Dashboard (Upload Portal):

Main features:
	•	An upload form where users can drag & drop or select:
	•	Up to 10 files at once
	•	File types: .jpg, .png, .mp4, .mov
	•	Chunked uploads or full file uploads (simulate chunking if needed)
	•	Each file should have:
	•	A preview
	•	A caption field
	•	A tag/multiple category input (multi-select or comma-separated)

Tech:
	•	Use FileReader to preview uploaded content
	•	Store uploaded content and metadata in localStorage or a temporary local object array (uploads[])
	•	Add visual status for “upload complete” or “queued”

⸻

🧠 Bonus Features (if possible):
	•	A counter for total uploads
	•	A simulated “training AI” progress bar (just visual)
	•	Include a “Submit to AI Engine” button that logs file data to console
	•	A fake “rotation preview” that mimics TikTok scroll with 2-3 uploaded videos

⸻

🧾 Pages Needed:
	1.	/index.html — landing/welcome screen with brand summary
	2.	/signup.html — user registration
	3.	/login.html — login page
	4.	/dashboard.html — creator upload dashboard
	5.	/style.scss — brand styles, compiled into CSS
	6.	/scripts/app.js — handles auth logic, upload, preview, and simple routing

⸻

📁 Folder Structure:

/nocturna-uploader
├── index.html
├── signup.html
├── login.html
├── dashboard.html
├── styles/
│   └── style.scss
├── scripts/
│   └── app.js
├── assets/
│   └── logo.svg (placeholder)
├── data/
│   └── uploads.json (for test output)


⸻

🧠 Final Instruction:

Keep everything fully responsive, clean, and “on-brand” with Nocturna’s elegant dark-night aesthetic. Prioritize UX and mobile-first behavior. This uploader is temporary and will be used to test AI algorithmic scroll behavior (similar to TikTok’s infinite feed) in future versions.

Build me an Admin Portal using HTML, SASS, and JavaScript that connects to the creator upload platform for my NSFW brand, Nocturna.

⸻

🛠️ Requirements:

Create a new route/page: admin.html
This should be protected by a simple admin login (hardcoded username/password is fine for now).

Once logged in, show the Admin Dashboard with two main tabs:

⸻

1. 👥 Creator Management

Display a table or card layout with all registered users from localStorage or users[] JSON. For each creator, show:
	•	Username
	•	Email
	•	Phone Number
	•	Date Joined
	•	Number of Uploads
	•	Last Active

Add sorting and search functionality by name, email, or join date.

⸻

2. 📂 Upload Monitoring

Display a list/grid of all uploaded content from all users, pulled from a shared local uploads[] array or simulated backend.

For each upload, show:
	•	Thumbnail preview (image or video icon)
	•	Caption
	•	Tags
	•	Upload date/time
	•	File type
	•	Uploaded by: (username or user ID)

Include filters to search by:
	•	File type (image / video)
	•	Uploader name
	•	Recent uploads (last 24h, last 7d, etc.)

Add a download or “View Full” button for each item.

⸻

🧾 Additional Features (Optional):
	•	A toggle to activate/deactivate a user
	•	Delete uploads or flag them
	•	Export all data to JSON or CSV
	•	Light/Dark theme switch (follow Nocturna color palette)
	•	Admin stats card: Total Users, Total Uploads, Active Today, etc.

⸻

🎨 Apply Brand Styling:

Use this Nocturna color palette across the Admin UI:
	•	#0B0B0F (Midnight Black – background)
	•	#5A2A6E (Deep Amethyst – accents, buttons)
	•	#7F3D67 (Velvet Plum – secondary highlights)
	•	#F6F5F3 (Moonlight White – text/input backgrounds)
	•	#E2A6B7 (Rosé Dust – badges, highlights)

Make the dashboard dark-themed, clean, responsive, and mobile-friendly.

⸻

📁 Folder Structure Update:

/nocturna-uploader
├── admin.html
├── login.html
├── dashboard.html
├── scripts/
│   ├── app.js (creator logic)
│   └── admin.js (admin logic)
├── data/
│   ├── users.json (or localStorage simulation)
│   └── uploads.json


⸻

✅ Final Notes:

This admin portal is used only internally to review user activity, test AI content, and audit uploads. Focus on data clarity, usability, and responsive UI. Link it cleanly from a secret /admin.html route behind login.
